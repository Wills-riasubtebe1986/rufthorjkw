Just walked out of the theater and gotta say, Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare felt like someone took my childhood, shook it up like a snow globe, and then just... let it settle with all the shards of childhood wonder and bewilderment still drifting down. Seriously, what did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? Is this what our disillusioned adulthood soaps look like now? It's like Peter Pan decided to grow up, but instead of getting a desk job, he signed up for a horror flick.

The plot? If you can call it that. Felt like they just threw every dark trope into a cauldron and hoped it would bubble up into something coherent. At one point, I couldn't tell if it was still Neverland or just my Thursday afternoon, minus the whimsical coffee shop. Captain Hook though? Man, that guy got some serious therapy or an even worse breakup than mine last year. How do you go from cartoon villain to something that haunts your sleep?

> And what happened to Tinker Bell?! If there's an analogy for a fruit fly stuck in honey before grimly accepting its sticky fate - that'd be her. Poor thing was buzzing ‘round like she'd been left out too long - sweet but trying too hard. Lady, just rest. Less trying to make stuff happen, more just existing like the rest of us in this vast metaphorical jar of peanut butter called life.

The graphics were a wild ride, too, in the kind of way that spirals your brain - like someone cranked up the saturation dial and then overcooked it. Neverland was literally bleeding color and shadows in one of those 'so real it’s fake' vibes. Call me old-school, but I remember when Neverland didn’t look like my phone screen on night 𝘮𝘰𝘥e.

```cpp
class Neverland {
public:
    void LostBoys(bool found) {
        found = !found; // irony is real
    }
};
```

After all that, I'm guessing Peter’s next adventure is figuring out therapy bills. Maybe if you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , the scenes will make more sense, like a puzzle piece you found behind the couch, or not. I dunno. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you’re into late-night reevaluations of your teenage years.

Anyway, hair still a mess from the whirlwind of thoughts. Might’ve been easier to tackle a matted dye job than this.
